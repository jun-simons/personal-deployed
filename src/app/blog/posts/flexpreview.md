Flex Preview is a VSCode Extension for mobile device simulation, making it easy to test responsive websites in VSCode.  It is available on the VSCode extention marketplace!

I built this after seeing existing options had poor functionality, limited device options, or required a paid license.

The project is written in Typescript, with HTML/CSS/JS webview.
